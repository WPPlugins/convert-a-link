= What is Convert-a-link ? =
Convert-a-link is a tool we created for our publishers to make the process of creating tracked affiliate links as easily as possible. This means that you can just add a standard link to your site and if this is going to one of the advertisers on our network then we will ensure that this is tracked, allowing you to earn commission should the user end up making a purchase.

The tool also facilitates relationships and as soon as you send traffic to one of our advertisers we will create a membership request to their program. This makes it even easier as you no longer have to search and apply for advertisers to promote.

Whether you are starting out in affiliate marketing or if you have a lot of old content you would like to monetize then this tool is for you.

Previously publishers had to put the Javascript link at the bottom of their WordPress page, which, some of our less technical publishers found very difficult. The only other option was to download the zipped plugin from the Awin publisher settings page and install as WordPress plugin. We found out, some publishers still need help to understand the mechanism.

So to make the process easier, Awin are releasing the convert-a-link plugin, which can be downloaded from the plugin directory and the Javascript will be added at the bottom of the page.

To make sure that the click is tracked we send certain information to Awin. The information sent contains the following:

* Timestamp

* Your publisher ID

* The advertiser’s ID

* IP address of referring click (your site)

The Javascript queries our list of active advertiser domains and their advertiser IDs so that it can quickly amend the link on your site to become a tracked Awin link. This conversion happens on click and the links in your code remain the same.

= How do I use it? =

Once the plugin is installed you will need to add your publisher ID in the plugin settings. You will also need to visit the Awin interface to activate convert-a-link for your profile.

= What pre-requisites are there for using this service? =

You have to be registered as a publisher on the Awin platform so that we can track sales generated from your site and attribute them to your publisher account. Sign up is a simple process which you can do here – https://ui.awin.com/affiliate-signup/account-details

All sign ups are vetted by our compliance team and as such, after signup, there is a small delay before you are accepted as an Awin publisher.
